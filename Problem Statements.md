## Problem 1-
Task
Given an integer, , perform the following conditional actions:

If  is odd, print Weird
If  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Not Weird
If  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Weird
If  is even and greater than , print Not Weird

*Input Format*
A single line containing a positive integer, .

*Constraints*
1 <= n <= 100

*Output Format*
Print Weird if the number is weird. Otherwise, print Not Weird.

Sample Input 0
3
Sample Output 0
Weird

Sample Input 1
24
Sample Output 1
Not Weird

## Problem 2- 
Task
The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN,  and . Add code to print three lines where:
The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

Example
a = 3
b = 5

Print the following:

8
-2
15

## Problem 3-
*Task*
The provided code stub reads two integers,  and , from STDIN.

Add logic to print two lines. The first line should contain the result of integer division,  // . The second line should contain the result of float division,  / .

No rounding or formatting is necessary.

*Example*


The result of the integer division .
The result of the float division is .
Print:

0
0.6

*Input Format*
The first line contains the first integer, .
The second line contains the second integer, .

*Output Format*

Print the two lines as described above.
